- Co-maintaining [Fuji](https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji), a mod loader for Celeste 64.
- [Origami](https://github.com/axiand/origami), a JavaScript API framework. (sparsely)
- Other things every now and then.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me...
If it's related to one of my projects: submit an issue / PR.

If it's something else or you're reporting a security issue: Send a message to the address on my profile.

Don't try to reach me over Discord, etc. I ignore friend requests from strangers!
